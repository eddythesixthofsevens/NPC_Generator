# NPC_Generator for Someone

## Highlights
- Generates as many NPCs as you ask with a simple command.
- Easy to use.
- Creates ally (or enemy) NPCs that could be used in battle situations.
- Names are truly random.

## Overview
This code was made just for your development journey! It uses the random library to generate random stats of different categories and makes NPCs good for anything (except romance, you weirdo)! The combat capabilities of the characters are clearly defined by their stats and you can put them in as allies or opponents, paired with your combat system (not included). The code is simple, readable, and organized in a manner that is easy to understand even for those with a basic understanding of python! I'd personally like to thank you, the people who paid me, a freshman in high school, to do this very important job! I appreciate the money in my pocket to buy gum from the corner store! I really only did this for the bag.

Hey! High school freshman Eyad Hassan here, the great creator of the code you asked me for! That's right, I'm the one who made this for you. Being a student in the Computer Science and Applied Engineering Academy at Voorhees High School, I only recently learned how to code with python. I'm happy that the code will be used for something big like this. This game will make waves in the community with its revolutionary price (from what I've heard, it's five dollars for the incredible quality) and my code, of course.
